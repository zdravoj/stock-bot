    "- No separate tickers between 'AT&T Corporation' and 'AT&T Inc'. Several tickers for the company appear, but they look like separate divisions / asset classes, rather than the company's stock before / after the merge or rename or whatever.\n",
    "- 'Allied Chemical Corporation' changed its name to 'AlliedSignal Incorporated', which then merged with and became 'Honeywell International'.\n",
    "- 'Aluminum Company of America' renamed to 'Alcoa Inc'.\n",
    "- 'American Can Company' merged with financial conglomerate 'Primarica Inc'.\n",
    "- 'American Telephone and Telegraph Company' changed its name to 'AT&T Corporation' (no surprise there).\n",
    "- 'American Tobacco Company' was restructured into a holding company called 'American Brands Inc'.\n",
    "- 'Anaconda Copper Mining Company' was purchased by ARCO and then BP.\n",
    "- 'Bethlehem Steel Corporation' declared bankruptcy in 2001. This is exactly the kind of company I would want to include in the bot, but alas, I'm not easily finding stock info on them.\n",
    "- 'Chrysler Corporation' bankrupted and was acquired by Fiat, the US, and Canada (not sure what that means - I'm assuming the stock price reflected the bankruptcy).\n",
    "- 'DowDuPont Inc' spun off (separated into?) DuPont and Dow Inc.\n",
    "- 'EI du Pont de Nemours & Company' is assumedly now 'DuPont de Nemours Inc', but how it mingled with Dow, DowDuPont, etc. is beyond me right now.\n",
    "- 'Esmark Corporation' is interwoven with 'JBS USA', but the two companies are too distinct to keep them properly on this list.\n",
