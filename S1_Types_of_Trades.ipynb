    "- Time-based: Stock will be purchased at $X$ time and sold at $X+\\Delta$ time.\n",
    "    - The simpler of the two types. Requires interval data. Will be approached probabilistically.\n",
    "    - Can use a variety of models, including regressions & neural networks.\n",
    "- Outcome-based: Sell and stop prices will be set, then stock will be purchased, then stock will be sold only when stock price reaches sell or stop price.\n",
    "    - Requires stock to be monitored at regular intervals. Requires calculating of sell and stop prices based on historical data.\n",
    "    - Requires models which can adjust and recalculate quickly. Likely requires simpler models like linear regressions. Will need to research time-based models also."
